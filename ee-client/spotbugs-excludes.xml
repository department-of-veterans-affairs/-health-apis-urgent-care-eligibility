    Line 88 of Soap Requester opens a url connection from the ee.endpoint.url in properties.
    To prevent Server Side Request forgery, the code checks the url protocol is HTTPS (E&E
    uses one way TLS) and that the request address is not local. If the url fails either of
    these checks, the connection is never made and the request fails.
